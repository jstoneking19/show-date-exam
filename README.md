# show-date-exam

This repository is for internal use. 
The contents of this repository include just the "main" code used in development. Due to redundancy and file size, other application files are left out.

# Contents
  - *backend* - contains files that run on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot); this shares an endpoint displaying the running server's date, time, and timezone. The experience of its creator is well-reflected on the filenames.
  - *frontend* - contains files that run on [Angular](https://angular.io/); this reads the backend's output and displays it in a _supposedly_ prettier output.
